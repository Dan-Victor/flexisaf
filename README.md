  Git and  Github

  Git
Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple people to work on a project without overriding each otherâ€™s changes. It tracks the history of changes in your files and makes it easier to collaborate, manage code, and revert to previous versions if needed. Git operates locally on your computer, allowing you to work offline and sync your work when you're ready.

GitHub
GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing and collaborating on Git projects. GitHub allows developers to share their projects, collaborate with others, and contribute to open-source software, offering features like pull requests, issue tracking, and wikis.
